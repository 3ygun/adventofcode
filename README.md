# Advent of Code

My adventures doing the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) challenges

# Versions

- [Go Lang](/golang/) version
    - Because in 2017 I was very interested in Go lang
    - Run with:
        1. `go build`
        1. `./golang -year 2017 -all`
- [Kotlin](/kotlin/) version
    - Because now I really like Kotlin mainly:
        - Non-Null datatypes
        - Basically everything else Go lang looked great for (harder binaries though :'( )
    - Run a specific day with `gradle run --args='-year 2025 -day 5'`
